Welcome! c:

Throughout this research, we are analyzing the community structure of CitiBank, the shared bike system of New York City, using the Louvain and Infomap community detection methods during the month of October, 2025! 



You can access the data we have used on the following link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/202510-citibike-tripdata.zip
By clicking the link, it will automatically download the zip file, which contains every ride that was conducted in October, 2025.

In order to identify the community districts, we have used a shapefile (.shp) from the cloud platform of ArcGIS Hub (After clicking on "Download" you are able to download it as "Shapefile"!)
